  <P style="margin-top:30px">ABOUT A <strong><u>HLB</u></strong></P>
  <p><span style="font-size:20px">stockLiver</span> cancer is the 6th most-selling disease worldwide and the 4th highest mortality rate. The 5-year survival rate is also 35.6%, which is unfortunate at half the average cancer survival rate of 70.4%. In China, it is the second highest incidence of cancer after lung cancer, and more than 50% of liver cancer patients in the world are Chinese.
  Aitan, which has a third gastric cancer on the market by Hangseo Pharmaceutical, is healthy and listed as the first insurance item, and sales have steadily increased from about 55 billion won in 2015 when it was first marketed to about 35 billion won in 2019.
  Currently, HLB is undergoing a global phase 3 clinical trial using riboseranib and anticancer drug Kamrelyzumab, an anticancer drug of anti-cancer medicine, aiming to be the primary use for liver cancer. Both Camrelizumab and Riboceranib have been approved for marketing in China as treatments for liver cancer.
  An official from HLB said, “The global phase 3 clinical patient recruitment aimed at the first borrowing of liver cancer is currently in the final stage and is progressing very rapidly.” “We will make it visible as the commercialization of gastric cancer, adenocyst cancer, and riboseranib.” Said.</p>

  <p><span style="font-size:20px">Smaller</span> tumors can live without blood vessels by receiving oxygen by diffusion, but to grow more than 2mm in diameter, oxygen and nutrients must be supplied through the blood. Cancer cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for growth. When VEGF binds to receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, it promotes angiogenesis,
  which supplies oxygen and nutrients.
  Metastasis can also occur through new blood vessels.
  These representative angiogenesis promoters, VEGF, vary in VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and PIGF (placentl growth factor). Vascular endothelial cells contain vascular endothelial cell receptors (VEGFR) -1, 2, and 3 that accept vascular endothelial growth factors, and VEGFR-2 is involved in angiogenesis of cancer.</p>
